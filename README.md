G51FSE-Pygame-Project
=====================

This is the repo for the G51FSE pygame Project for the software engineering module in my first year of computer science at the university of nottingham
In this piece of coursework, I had to observe and implement and agile software engineering process whilst working with one other in pairs programming (XTreme). Our task was described as follows:



Game Concept
We aim to emulate an agile development team working for a small game development company, called NG2 Games. We are required to produce an inventive 2D game, including a prototype and larger full version and all supporting documentation. The game aims to emulate a typical 'space invaders' game crossed with a 'shoot 'em up' such that the enemy will continuously fire
randomly and aggressively. The game adopts well known concepts from other similar arcade games such that it satisfies the requirements extracted from the user stories.
