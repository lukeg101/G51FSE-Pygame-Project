G51FSE-Pygame-Project
=====================

This is the repo for the G51FSE pygame Project for the software engineering module in my first year of computer science at the University of Nottingham
In this piece of coursework, I had to observe and implement and agile software engineering process whilst working with one other in pairs programming (XTreme). Our task was described as follows:

Overview
========
You are tasked to find a partner and to create a 2D Arcade game. You will have
a choice over what game you wish to make and a choice of implementation language.
Through this process, in your pairs you are to develop the game from its initial
specification, through design, protytping, refinement, implementation, testing, and
evaluation stages. You are required to deliver a demo for a prototype, a completed game
and a portfolio.

Learning Objectives
=========
Coursework Learning Objectives:
1. To perform the process of software engineering from start to completion, demonstrating
evidence of ability and aptitude for each stage of the process.
2. To be able to program and develop effectively in pairs.
3. To demonstrate original thought and creativity in software production.
4. To show use of the appropriate software engineering methodologies and diagrams.
5. To comply with the attendance procedures specified for the lab sessions.
6. To gain experience in working with external code and libraries
7. To apply programming knowledge to a new language
8. To be able to manage source code through version control systems 

Game Concept
============
We aim to emulate an agile development team working for a small game development company, called NG2 Games. We are required to produce an inventive 2D game, including a prototype and larger full version and all supporting documentation. The game aims to emulate a typical 'space invaders' game crossed with a 'shoot 'em up' such that the enemy will continuously fire
randomly and aggressively. The game adopts well known concepts from other similar arcade games such that it satisfies the requirements extracted from the user stories.

Project Breakdown
=================
We broke down the project into the following areas:
1. Requirements Gathering and elicitation - getting requirements, use case and software requirements specification from the users
2. Design - creating a basic design and rapid prototype for the proposed system, we made a basic game as a demonstration of concept and refine the requirements for the user.
3. Implementation - Most of the user requirements were realised here in order to fully cater for the needs of the user, agile sprints were used to get certain sections done.
4. Testing - The code we had written had to be tested to ensure correct and proper functionality. Some of this was done as part of Test Driven Development.
5. User Evaluation - We would approach the user at various stages of development in order to gather feedback, more requirements and refine those we already had.

As this project was completed in an agile manner, (we also used Spiral, TDD and Extreme at different stages); many of the stages were repeated in order to fully cater for all requirements of the user.
