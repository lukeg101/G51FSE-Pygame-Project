G51FSE-Pygame-Project
=====================

This is the repo for the G51FSE pygame Project for the software engineering module in my first year of computer science at the University of Nottingham
In this piece of coursework, I had to observe and implement and agile software engineering process whilst working with one other in pairs programming (XTreme). Our task was described as follows:

Overview
========
You are tasked to find a partner and to create a 2D Arcade game. You will have
a choice over what game you wish to make and a choice of implementation language.
Through this process, in your pairs you are to develop the game from its initial
specification, through design, protytping, refinement, implementation, testing, and
evaluation stages. You are required to deliver a demo for a prototype, a completed game
and a portfolio.

Learning Objectives
=========
Coursework Learning Objectives:
• To perform the process of software engineering from start to completion, demonstrating
evidence of ability and aptitude for each stage of the process.
• To be able to program and develop effectively in pairs.
• To demonstrate original thought and creativity in software production.
• To show use of the appropriate software engineering methodologies and diagrams.
• To comply with the attendance procedures specified for the lab sessions.
• To gain experience in working with external code and libraries
• To apply programming knowledge to a new language
• To be able to manage source code through version control systems 

Game Concept
============
We aim to emulate an agile development team working for a small game development company, called NG2 Games. We are required to produce an inventive 2D game, including a prototype and larger full version and all supporting documentation. The game aims to emulate a typical 'space invaders' game crossed with a 'shoot 'em up' such that the enemy will continuously fire
randomly and aggressively. The game adopts well known concepts from other similar arcade games such that it satisfies the requirements extracted from the user stories.

Peoject Breakdown

We broke down the project into the following areas:
